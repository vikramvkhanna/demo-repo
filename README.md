## CloudFormation Template description
This template -
- Creates required number of Citrix BYOL ADC with 3 ENIs each, associated to 3 VPC subnets (Management, Client, Server)
- Allocates a user defined license to the above created ADCs

## Pre-requisites
The CloudFormation template requires sufficient permissions to create IAM roles, beyond normal EC2 full privileges. The user of this template also needs to [accept the terms and subscribe to the AWS Marketplace product](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00AA01BOE) before using this CloudFormation template.
<p>The following should be present - </p>

- VPC connected to Internet Gateway
- 3 Subnetworks (in the same availability zones)
	- Management side Subnet
	- Client side Subnet
	- Server side Subnet
- Enough number of unallocated EIPs to attach to Management and Client interfaces of of each created ADC
> Each instance of ADC requires 2 EIPs - One for Management and the other for Client side
- Rechable ADM/ ADM-Agent configured as license server

## Output
The output of the CloudFormation template includes:

- `InstanceIDsWithIPs`: IPs of created BYOL ADCs with their respective EC2 instance-IDs in `{ip:instance}` format
